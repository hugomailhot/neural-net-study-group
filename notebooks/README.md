# How to use these notebooks

If you don't already know how, I would recommend that you learn to setup and launch Jupyter notebooks.
They are a powerful tool for anyone using Python, and particularly useful for data science and code testing.
[Here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a link to a quickstart guide.
Once you have jupyter installed, all you have to do in go in your terminal and type

`$ jupyter notebook /path/to/the/notebook`

The path can be relative to your current directory.

An easier option is to use the URLs below.

## Binder links to notebook instances
These links provide fully functional, ready to go notebooks built and hosted with all required dependencies on a remote server.
That is how awesome [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is. You can even modify the code and run it again to see what happens.
